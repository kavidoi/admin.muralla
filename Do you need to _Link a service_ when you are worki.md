# Do you need to "Link a service" when you are working via api and not CLI to be able to prompt deploys and read logs?

**No, you do NOT need to "link a service" when working via the Railway GraphQL API instead of the CLI.**

Here's the key difference:

## CLI vs API Authentication \& Linking

### CLI Approach

When using the Railway CLI, you need to:

1. **Link to a project**: `railway link <project_id>` - establishes local context
2. **Run commands**: CLI uses the linked project context for deployments and logs

### API Approach

When using the GraphQL API directly, you:

1. **Authenticate with tokens**: No linking required - you specify target resources directly in GraphQL queries/mutations[^1][^2]
2. **Target resources explicitly**: Each API call specifies exactly which project/service/environment to interact with

## Direct API Operations Without Linking

### Deploy via API (No Linking Needed)

```javascript
// Redeploy service directly via GraphQL mutation
const resp = await fetch('https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'authorization': `Bearer ${TOKEN}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: `
      mutation ServiceInstanceRedeploy {
        serviceInstanceRedeploy(
          environmentId: "${ENVIRONMENT_ID}"
          serviceId: "${SERVICE_ID}"
        )
      }
    `
  }),
})
```


### Read Logs via API (No Linking Needed)

```javascript
// Get deployment logs directly
const logsQuery = `
  query GetDeploymentLogs($deploymentId: String!) {
    deployment(id: $deploymentId) {
      logs {
        message
        timestamp
        severity
      }
    }
  }
`
```


## Key Points About API vs CLI

### API Benefits:[^3][^1]

- **Direct targeting**: Specify exact resources (project, service, environment) in each call
- **No local state**: No need to maintain linked project context
- **Programmatic control**: Perfect for automation and AI workflows
- **Token-based**: Uses project tokens, account tokens, or team tokens directly


### When Each Approach Makes Sense:

- **CLI**: Interactive development, local workflow, manual operations
- **API**: Automation, CI/CD, AI-driven deployments, programmatic management


## Example: Complete AI Automation Without CLI Linking

```javascript
// AI can manage Railway entirely through API calls
class RailwayAPIManager {
  constructor(token) {
    this.token = token;
    this.endpoint = 'https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2';
  }

  async deployService(projectId, serviceId, environmentId) {
    // Direct deployment - no linking required
    return this.mutation(`
      mutation {
        serviceInstanceRedeploy(
          environmentId: "${environmentId}"
          serviceId: "${serviceId}"
        )
      }
    `);
  }

  async getLogs(deploymentId) {
    // Direct log access - no linking required
    return this.query(`
      query {
        deployment(id: "${deploymentId}") {
          logs { message timestamp }
        }
      }
    `);
  }
}
```


## Summary

**The Railway API is designed to work without the "linking" concept** - each API call explicitly targets the resources it needs to interact with using IDs. This makes it ideal for AI automation, CI/CD pipelines, and programmatic management where you want direct, stateless control over your Railway infrastructure.[^4][^1]
